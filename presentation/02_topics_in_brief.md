# Revision Control?

 - [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contributing_to_Wikipedia)
 - [Google Docs](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/190843?rd=1)
 - NOT a backup
 - Collaboration
 - NOT just for code!

# So if Git is a *distributed* revision control system, what is a **centralized** revision controll system?

---

# Then what is Github?

 - Social Coding
 - Centralization (I *know*, right?)
 - Authentication
 - Policy, teams, etc

Note:
mention how some repos on Github are just mirrors

# But wait, there's more!

 - Issues
 - Built in Wiki
 - Collaboration Tools
 - Visualizations
 - Stats, stats, stats!
